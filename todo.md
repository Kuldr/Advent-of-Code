# Todo

## Engineering improvements
- change clunky test cases in to python asserts
- mypy api check when running testing
- Python typing on variables and functions etc.
- SnakeViz - would need package instal
- Run unittest and mypy on run?? edit the .replit file
- Move profiling into the main script

## Feature improvements
- Collections Library
  - Counter
  - Deque
- functools.cache
- Other Languages
  - Haskell
  - Swift

## Days to improve
- 2019 AllDay - Clean up code
- 2019 Day 02 - Start intcode, copy over from colab
- 2019 Day 05 - intcode part 2
- 2019 Day 07 - Another intcode
- 2020 Day 16 - No longer have the correct code for part 2
- 2021 Day 07 - Could use numpy for array operations
- 2021 Day 13 - How to make the tests work out the letters
- 2021 Day 17 - Find all values of xs and ys for given starting x and y velocity seperately and find the collisions | Could make use of a generator function to do this?? Maybe a dictionary of stored generators?
